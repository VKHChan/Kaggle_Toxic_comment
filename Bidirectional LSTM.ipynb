Tell me, what is this magical formula that allows someone to be quoted in this article? You keep saying they need to be scientists, yet these two men are clearly climate scientists. But on the other hand, lots of non-scientists are quoted so long as they support AGW. Funny how that works, isn't it? You are clearly violating Wikipedia's rule of Gatekeeping an article.
